Circle
#######

This entity is specified by its center point, by its diameter, and by
its normal.

To create the circle:

#. Choose :menuselection:`Sketch --> Circle`.
#. Left-click the center.
#. Then release the mouse button; the diameter of the circle is now
   being dragged.
#. Left-click again to place the diameter.

If a workplane is active, then the center point must lie in that
workplane, and the circle's normal is parallel to the workplane's
normal (which means that the circle lies in the plane of the
workplane).

If no workplane is active, then the center point is free in space, and
the normal may be dragged (or constrained) to determine the circle's
orientation.
