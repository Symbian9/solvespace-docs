Arc
####

This entity is specified by its center point, the two endpoints, and
its normal.

To create the arc:

#. Choose :menuselection:`Sketch --> Arc`.
#. Left-click one of its endpoints.
#. Then release the mouse button; the other endpoint is now being
   dragged.
   The center is also being dragged, in such a way as to form an exact
   semi-circle.
#. Left-click again to place the other endpoint.
#. Drag the center to the desired position.
   The arc is drawn counter-clockwise from the first point to the
   second.

The arc must be drawn in a workplane; it cannot be drawn in free space.
