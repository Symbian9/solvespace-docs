Workplane
##########

This entity is specified by a point and a normal.  The point defines
its origin, and the normal defines its orientation.

A workplane makes it possible to draw a section in 2D.  If a workplane
is active, then any entities that are drawn must lie in that workplane.

It's almost never necessary to create workplanes explicitly.  Instead,
create a new :guilabel:`Sketch` in :guilabel:`New Workplane` group.
