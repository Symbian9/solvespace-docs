Rectangle
##########

This entity consists of two vertical line segments, and two horizontal
line segments, arranged to form a closed curve. Initially, the
rectangle is specified with the mouse by two diagonally opposite
corners. The line segments (and points) in the rectangle may be
constrained in the same way as ordinary line segments.

It would be possible to draw the same figure by hand, by drawing four
line segments and inserting the appropriate constraints. The rectangle
command is a faster way to draw the exact same thing.

A workplane must be active when the rectangle is drawn, since the
workplane defines the meaning of 'horizontal' and 'vertical'.
