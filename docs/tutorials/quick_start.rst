Quick Start
############

The first time SolveSpace runs, you will see an empty workplane.

To draw a line, choose the :menuselection:`Sketch --> Line Segment` (or
:menuselection:`Circle`, or :menuselection:`Arc`, or ...) menu. Then
left-click to define the endpoints.

Hit :kbd:`Esc` if you want to stop drawing before you've formed a
closed contour.

Right-drag to pan, center-drag to rotate, and mousewheel to zoom.

To align the view's rotation back to the workplane, choose
:guilabel:`View --> Align View to Workplane`.

To select a line, hover the mouse over the line (it turns yellow), and
left-click (it turns red). To dimension the line's length, choose
:menuselection:`Constrain --> Distance/Diameter`.

To move the dimension, drag it. To change the dimension, double-click
it, type a number, and hit :kbd:`Enter`.

To learn more about SolveSpace, see the ref:`tutorials`, or the
:ref:`reference` manual.
