Midpoint
#########

This constraint forces a point to lie on the midpoint of a line.

The at-midpoint constraint can also force the midpoint of a line to lie
on a plane; this is equivalent to creating a datum point, constraining
it at the midpoint of the line, and then constraining that midpoint to
lie on the plane.
