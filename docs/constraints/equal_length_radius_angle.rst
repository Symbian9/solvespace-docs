Equal Length/Radius/Angle
##########################

This constraint forces two lengths, angles, or radiuses to be equal.

The equal-angle constraint requires four vectors as input: the two
equal angles are the angle between each pair of inputs.  For example,
select line segments A, B, C, and D.  The constraint forces the angle
between lines A and B to be equal to the angle between lines C and D.
If the wrong supplementary angle is chosen, then choose Constrain â†’
Other Supplementary Angle, as for the angle constraint.

If a line and an arc of a circle are selected, then the length of the
line is forced equal to the length (not the radius) of the arc.
