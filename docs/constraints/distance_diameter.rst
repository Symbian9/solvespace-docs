Distance/Diameter
##################

This constraint sets the diameter of an arc or a circle, or the length
of a line segment, or the distance between a point and some other
entity.

When constraining the distance between a point and a plane, or a point
and a plane face, or a point and a line in a workplane, the distance is
signed.  The distance may be positive or negative, depending on whether
the point is above or below the plane.  The distance is always shown
positive on the sketch; to flip to the other side, enter a negative
value.
