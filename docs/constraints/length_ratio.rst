Length Ratio
#############

This constraint sets the ratio between the lengths of two line
segments.  For example, if line A and line B have length ratio 2:1,
then the constraint is satisfied if A is 50 mm long and B is 25 mm
long.

The order in which the lines are selected matters; if line A is
selected before line B, then the ratio is length of A:length of B.
